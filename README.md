# #ILOVEReact :heart_eyes: - By JONDJONES.COM 

\#ILOVEReact is an on-going collaboration of tutorials, packages, meet-ups and ideas of all things React.  The aim of this project is to help web developers become true software crafts people.  Why waste hours trying to remember that website you once found randomly Googling.  This area is a on-stop shop to get you set-up and building applications.
