# Introductiomn

In this task, you will implement a news reader. Your application will make it easy to browse
a list of articles featured on Hacker News. You will be expected to use React but beyond
this, you are free to make whatever technology choices you think best.
Your application should make use of the Hacker News API to provide a list of the most
recent stories. The documentation for this API is available at:

https://github.com/HackerNews/API

Quoting the README, "it's not the ideal public API". You are expected to account for these
limitations in your application, providing a beautiful user experience despite the limitations.
Equal focus will be given to the user experience and the quality of the code. Ultimately, we
care about building beautiful products for our users and so the experience you provide is
paramount.

# Requirements

Your solution should contain your source code and a README containing build and
deployment instructions. You may assume the engineer assessing your solution has
working Node.js and yarn installations.

Please provide your solution using a code-sharing service (for example, Github or Gitlab)
or by sharing a single archive file (for example, a .zip or .tar.gz file). In the latter case,
please use an appropriate file-sharing service (for example, Firefox Send or Google Drive).
We encourage you to reach out to us here at Synthesia if you have any questions. We're
looking forward to seeing your work!
