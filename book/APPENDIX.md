## Equipment I Use

 Dell is known for making great products.  This monitor is no exception.  It doesn't give me eye-strain.  I can have a split screen on two HDMIs, so I view a MAC and a PC on the screen at the same time.  Plugging the HDMI cables could be easier, aides from that its worth buying.
-   [ASUS ZenBook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0765CBZZK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B0765CBZZK&linkCode=as2&tag=iwillteacyout-21&linkId=9e665022954ab5683f288ba01331f3ea)
As a contractor I've had a lot of laptops (currently over 10 dells)>  I prefer the Zenbook over all of them.  It's quick, light, keyboards good.  The only downside are the speakers are too quiet.

When I've doing Javascript coding or video editing I use a mac-mini.  Its handy to have a desktop and the mac-mini is the best small looking computer.
-   [Bose QuietComfort 35 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0756GB78C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0756GB78C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jondjones-20&amp;linkId=44072f501e920ee55d54dec7343f6f3c)  
I can't recommend these enough.  When you put them on they block everything out. Sounds amazing.  The charge lasts for ages.  It recharges really quickly.  I was skeptical about buying battery powered headphones, but these are much better than wired
-   [FSDUALWIN Aluminum Laptop Monitor Stand Space Bar, Monitor Riser MacBook Monitor Dock Desk Organizer with 4 USB Ports, Keyboard Storage](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N9SMY31/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01N9SMY31&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jondjones-20&amp;linkId=48ba71a8745824b5d6b846e9b13288d1)
